## About This Project

This analysis was made as part of my path to learning Data Science. What you will find here is:

### A cleaned and completed dataset
This serves as a good example for an introduction to Data Management and Data Analysis.

### Understanding the DataFrame
In this exploration, I found the dataset was quite good and well-organized, but it had some missing values.

### Handling missing data
Even though missing data represented a small percentage, I decided to fill it using both correlations with other variables and proportions.

### Data validation
I validated the dataset by cross-referencing it with real data from that era.

### Variable exploration
I explored every variable and got to the bottom of outliers and censored data.

### Relationships between variables
I established relationships between variables, then categorized the data to find more patterns. I noticed the difference between doing simple relational analysis versus using categorized and filtered data.

### Filtering and hypothesis testing
It was useful to filter parts of the data to establish relationships and test hypotheses.

### Linear regression
Finally, I applied linear regression to prove dependencies between variables and cleaned some censored data to improve precision.

## Conclusions

I found that house prices in California are primarily influenced by three factors:

* Ocean proximity
* Median income
* Location in urban areas
